  abstract = {1. The dynamics of a virus disease in a perennial plant population 
are modelled. The population is divided into healthy, latently infected, 
infectious and post-infectious plants and linked differential equations 
describe the dynamics of each category. 2. Qualitative analysis of this model 
shows stable dynamics and threshold conditions for disease persistence. Stable 
equilibria are reached after several years. The dynamics of the model are 
highly sensitive to changes in contact rate and infectious period. 3. Disease 
management by roguing (removal) of infected plants and replanting with healthy 
ones is investigated. Roguing only in the post-infectious category confers no 
advantage. At low contact rates, roguing only when plants become infectious is 
sufficient to eradicate the disease. At high contact rates, roguing latently 
infected as well as infectious plants is advisable. 4. With disease present the 
equilibrium level of healthy plants does not depend on replanting rate, but at 
higher replanting rates the disease is more difficult to eradicate. There is a 
trade-off between roguing and replanting in designing optimal disease 
management strategies. 5. Using parameter values estimated from field studies 
on three plant virus diseases, the model indicates that eradication is 
achievable with realistic roguing intensities.},

  abstract = {Most plant viruses are vectored by arthropods, often Homopteran 
insects. Four general classes of plant-virus diseases have been recognized; 
they are distinguished by the transmission characteristics and the nature of 
the interaction of the virus with the vector. For nonpersistently transmitted 
viruses, the virus is usually restricted to the stylet of the insect. For 
persistently transmitted viruses, the virus is ingested, passes through the gut 
wall into the haemolymph, and then moves to the salivary glands where it can 
potentially be transmitted to other plants. Persistently transmitted viruses, 
have two subclasses termed circulative if there is no multiplication in the 
insect vector and propagative if there is. A fourth class, semipersistent, 
which is intermediate between nonpersistent and persistent, is generally 
recognized; in this class the virus moves to the foregut of the insect. A model 
has been developed in which an SEIR-type epidemic for the host plant is linked 
with the insect vector population (an SEI model with vertical transmission) to 
describe the transmission process. This model was used to compare the 
transmission characteristics of the four virus classes directly, and to explore 
the consequences for epidemic development and possible control options. 
Depending on the assumptions made about migration, it was possible to obtain an 
expression for the basic reproductive number, R0. Expressions were also 
obtained for equilibrium values for the host and vector population classes; and 
a numerical analysis indicated that these equilibria were stable for known or 
reasonable estimates of the parameter values. The basic reproductive number, 
R0, was used to examine the relative contributions of key parameters in 
distinguishing the four virus disease classes using parameter values and ranges 
taken directly from the literature or estimated indirectly. Pairwise plots of 
parameter values which satisfied the threshold criterion R0= 1 clearly 
separated the propagative class from the other categories. On holding the other 
parameters constant, a much larger vector population or vector activity was 
required to satisfy the epidemic threshold for propagative viruses. Similar 
conclusions were reached from plots of the healthy host and viruliferous vector 
populations against key parameters. The model framework was used to analyse the 
effectiveness of roguing (the removal and destruction) of diseased plants 
and/or reduction of the vector-population size, for example, by insecticide 
treatment or vegetation management. Roguing would only be effective for 
nonpersistently transmitted viruses at relatively low vector-population 
densities. Roguing would usually only be needed for propagative viruses at very 
high population densities. There would be a clear advantage in reducing the 
vector-population density for propagative viruses, and control measures aimed 
at reducing populations would only be effective for these viruses.},

  abstract = {1. A number of insect vectors of plant-virus diseases make only 
transitory visits to the crop in which the economic effects of the disease are 
important. The incidence of disease in the crop depends primarily on the 
immigration of vectors from alternative hosts which act as a reservoir of both 
the virus and vector. 2. An epidemiological model was developed to represent 
this situation and parameters were estimated for the case of tomato leaf curl 
virus disease (TLCVD) (Geminiviridae, Subgroup III) in India. From an analysis 
of the model, the following possibilities for the management of TLCVD emerged. 
3. It was clear that varietal resistance to infection could be an important 
component of disease management but whether, once infected, the tomato plants 
acted as a source of inoculum had little impact on disease incidence in the 
tomato crop. 4. A very low rate of simulated vector immigration into a tomato 
crop sufficed to cause almost total infection. Around Bangalore, vectors may 
migrate into tomato crops in numbers in excess of those required for disease 
'saturation', explaining why, using conventional insecticides, very efficient 
and intensive vector control is currently required to reduce disease incidence. 
5. Disease incidence was sensitive to vector mortality only when vector numbers 
were low. In most cases, the immigration of viruliferous vectors made disease 
incidence insensitive to the mortality of vectors within the tomato crop. 6. A 
strategy for disease management which targets more than one of the parameters 
to which the model proved most sensitive is likely to be necessary. In 
particular, the use of protective netting combined with the growing of 
resistant varieties has the potential to reduce both B. tabaci immigration to 
the crop and to reduce virus inoculation by those insects which do reach the 
crop.},

Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) by the silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia

esculentum (Miller) (Solanales: Solanaceae), seedlings that were inoculated

materials that are nearing registration for use on tomato-cyazypyr, 
flupyradifurone, pyrafluquinazon, and sulfoxaflor-and to compare them with two 
established insecticides, pymetrozine and a zeta-cypermethrin/bifenthrin 
combination. Differences in efficacy were expected because these six materials 
represent five distinct modes of action and both contact and systemic 
materials. Percentage of tomato seedlings expressing virus symptoms tended to 
be lowest in seedlings treated with flupyradifurone. The 
zeta-cypermethrin/bifenthrin insecticide demonstrated comparable efficacy to 
flupyradifurone in some trials at 3 and 7 d after treatment inoculations, but 
not the 14 d after treatment inoculation. Pyrafluquinazon was not statistically 
different from cyazypyr or sulfoxaflor in percentage of plants with virus 
symptoms in any trial. Percentage virus in the cyazypyr and sulfoxaflor 
treatments was not statistically different in the 3 and 7 d after treatment 
inoculations. Among seedlings treated with insecticide, percentage with virus 
symptoms tended to be highest in the seedlings treated with pymetrozine.},

  abstract = {Abstract Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) has been considered as a 
serious pest in all of tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of the 
world. B. tabaci first recorded as early as in 1940s in China and has been 
reported as a pest of various crops in 22 provinces or cities. But only 
recently it has become a severe problem for vegetable and ornamental crops in 
Guangdong and Beijing. In China B. tabaci is known to transmit at least 5 plant 
viruses, including tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), tomato leaf curl 
virus (TomLCV), squash leaf curl virus (SqLCV-C). So far, approximately 18 
parasitoids, 17 predators and 1 pathogenic fungus were recorded in China. This 
paper presents an overview of B. tabaci as a pest and virus vector in China, 
with special attention given to non-chemical control strategies.
